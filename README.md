# Get-To-A-Hundred
This is a math game project I created while learning C++

As the title describes, the only way to win this gamae is by reaching 100 first.

This is a simple game where the starting number is 0, you and the computer will enter a number one at a time that will add up to one another.
The player who manages to reach 100 (make the starting number 100) win the game. The decision on which will enter the number first  is determined by a random number 1 for player and 0 for computer.

You will play this game againts the computer and you can choose 3 difficulties. The rules will be displayed when you run the code.

The code is also filled with comments to help you understand what's happening in the code

There is a PvP version which will be uploaded soon
